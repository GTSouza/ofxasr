=Frequently Asked Questions=

===Which languages will it be possible to use ?===
This addon is independent from language.

Which language an ASR engine support depends on the type of the acoustic model and the language model, however, to train such models is not an easy thing, that need huge of sound data.

There're some open source organisations provide models, such as voxforge (http://www.voxforge.org/). Most open source models are in English, so, the first release of ofxASR shipped an opensource English model.

It is very easy to replace the model by yourself, just download(or train) a new model and copy it to the special path.

===What components do I need to build an oF based application with speech-recognition?===
First, of course you need download [http://www.openframeworks.cc/download OpenFrameworks] for your platform.

Then, you need download this addon. Download ofxasr_x.xx.tar.gz from our download page, where the "x.xx" is the newest version number.

In addition, you MUST have a sphinx-compatible resource package, which should contain an acoustics model, a language model, and dictionary. In our download page, a simple resource package is provide that can recognize English digits.

===Why the resource package is required? What is it?===
Most state-of-art speech recognition engine is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and the resource package contains
the resources that a HMM-based recognition engine need.

A resource package must contain:
  * Dictionary: Any word that not in the dictionary can not be recognized.
  * Acoustics Model (AM): The acoustics statistical data.
  * Language Model (LM): The linguistics statistical data.

Although this addon wss designed as independent from the speech engine, it only support Sphinx in the current version. Therefore,
the components(dictionary, AM, LM) in the resource package must be sphinx-compatible.

===Where can I get a resource package?===
Our download page provided a very simple resource package, it can only recognize English digits, that means even you speak something else, it still give the most similar English digits as the recognition result. We will provide more ready-to-use packages in future.

A resource package in fact is a folder that contains dictionary, AM and LM. To get a better resource package, you can download components from somewhere else. Here are some sites:

http://www.keithv.com/software/sphinx/

http://www.repository.voxforge1.org/downloads/Main/Trunk/AcousticModels/Sphinx/

And there are many other sites also provides sphinx resource.

You can also train AM and LM by yourself. To learn more about train a model, read [http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/ sphinx's documents]. But we do not suggest you training models by yourself, because it need huge audio data and it is not a very easy thing.
